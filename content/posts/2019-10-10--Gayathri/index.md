My experience so far has been very exciting. I somehow had convinced my self that I would be struggling on the second day as I missed the first day because of my assignments.
Now after submitting 2 of the 4 PR's I feel so much more confident and exhilarated to win one of the prizes XD. This seesion has been very helpful.Hope to see many more such FESTS in the near future!!
